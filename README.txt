HTML5 Content-editable text editor for Moodle

QUICK INSTALL
=============
Put this entire directory at:

PATHTOMOODLE/lib/editors/contenteditable

Visit your site notifications page to install the new plugins.

Enable the new editor type by default on the page:

Site administration / ► Plugins / ► Text editors / ► Manage editors

Also - change the order so this editor is the first in the list.

Caveats:

This editor does not implement Moodle Media, Moodle Image or tables plugins (yet).

It does support repositories for links though - other types will come soon.

So it is not yet a complete replacement for TinyMCE.
